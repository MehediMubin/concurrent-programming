# Concurrent Programming in Go

Welcome to the **Concurrent Programming** repository! This project is a collection of case studies, experiments, and implementations focused on **concurrent programming concepts** using **Go (Golang)**. The goal is to explore, understand, and apply patterns of concurrency to real-world problems.

---

## Overview

In this repository, I brainstorm and solve different concurrency-related challenges. Each solution emphasizes:

- **Goroutines & Channels**: Efficiently running multiple tasks in parallel and communicating between them.
- **Synchronization**: Avoiding race conditions and ensuring thread-safe operations.
- **Parallelism**: Optimizing performance by executing independent tasks concurrently.
- **Problem-solving mindset**: Tackling real-world scenarios that require concurrent solutions.

This repo is designed both as a **learning resource** for Go concurrency and as a **demonstration of practical coding skills** in scalable, concurrent systems.

## Key Features

- Implementations of classic concurrency problems and patterns.
- Use of Goroutines, Channels, Mutexes, and WaitGroups.
- Emphasis on writing clean, maintainable, and production-ready concurrent code.
- Case studies cover a variety of real-world scenarios.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/concurrent-programming.git

2. Navigate to the project directory: 
   ```bash
